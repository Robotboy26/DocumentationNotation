First, we will define 4 constants that will be used later.


BITS 16
org 0x7C00 ; This is the normal bootloader start location and should not be changed.

entry:  ; most of this should be set by default but it is best to explicitly set it.
cli   			 ; Disable interrupts
cld   			 ; Clear direction flag
; reset the stack
xor eax, eax ; floor eax
mov ss, ax
mov es, ax
mov ds, ax
mov sp, 0x7C00   ; the stack moves down from this location.
sti   			 ; Enable interrupts
