Hello world, I am going to document my journey on making my own x86 64-bit operating system using only assembly (at least for the time being).
-Ubuntu22.04
-Git
-Qemu (for emulation)
-Nasm (the assembler)
-Neovim (or the editor of your choice)
-Pure64 (https://github.com/ReturnInfinity/Pure64)
-BareMetal-OS (https://github.com/ReturnInfinity/BareMetal-OS)
-myOS-Archive (some of my old attempts at doing this project) (https://github.com/Robotboy26/myOS-Archive)
BIOS - <website here>

sudo apt install git qemu qemu-system-x86 nasm Neovim

Environment setup, open up your terminal (‘Ctrl-Alt-t’ for Ubuntu):

We are now going to create a shell file that will automatically compile the source and then load it onto a virtual drive and launch it with Qemu (CPU emulation). We are going to name this file "qemu.sh". In this file, we are first going to remove any past binaries and then assemble 3 files using Nasm. These files are "mbr.asm" (Master Boot Record). This will be a 512-byte file that will be the first stage of our bootloader. The MBR will (roughly) start in 16-bit mode then elevate to 32-bit, then 64-bit mode. Somewhere in there, the MBR will activate the A20 line (I will explain this later). Finally, the MBR will read the bootloader file into memory and run it. The second file will be "bootloader.asm". This is the second part of our bootloader that will be loaded by the MBR. This second bootloader will do a great many things. The most notable in my opinion is the IDT but we will get to that much later. Finally will assemble the actual operating system code. Right after assembling, we will combine the second part of the bootloader and all of the operating system code into one file (this will be important later).
--- qemu.sh -
rm -r bin
nasm src/boot/mbr.asm -o bin/mbr.bin
nasm src/boot/bootloader.asm -o bin/bootloader.bin
nasm src/os.asm -o bin/os.asm
sudo qemu-system-x86_64 -drive format=raw,file=bin/disk.img

Now we will do a few more things first tell the NASM (the assembler) that we will be writing a 16-bit assembly. You might be thinking "Wait, why would we use 16-bit assembly? I thought we were making a 64-bit operating system". The reason why we start with 16-bit is because even though modern CPUs can run 64-bit there was a time when 16-bit was the only thing they could run and for compatibility reasons, we still started in 16-bit mode. This might sound like a bad thing, that we have to go through 16-bit assembly before we can use 64-bit assembly and in some regards this is true it does make it a bit more annoying. One of the benefits of starting in 16-bit mode is that you have access to BIOS interrupts; these will make it much easier to do many things we will talk about shortly.
Let's get into what these next lines are doing, hopefully, it should be pretty self-explanatory. I will quickly go over it. The command "cli" is used to disable interrupts. This is specifically talking about hardware interrupts which we will fully cover later so you don't have to worry about it too much right now but for a short example hardware interrupts include things like the computer clock, the keyboard, and the mouse. The next line "cld" is the command to clear the directional flag <add more stuff here>. The next few lines up until "sti'' have to do with resetting the stack if you do not know the stack it's a FILO (First In Last Out) memory structure. This is best explained with an example. Think about a stack of plates where you write a number onto each plate, you put one plate down then 2 plates down and instead of being able to take off the first plate you first need to take off the second plate or in other words, the first plate you put down is the last one you will take off<Provide a better example or a link>. How you reset we reset the stack and it is pretty simple first the line "xor eax, eax" This will floor the number if you don't know what that means it just means set the number to zero. You might be wondering why we xor eax with itself instead of doing something like mov eax, 0. The reason why we use xor eax, eax is just because it is "safer" and it's just the correct way to do it. Once we have zero in the eax register we can move the eax register into other registers to also set them to zero. Again you might be wondering why we do it this way and it's mostly just because it's the accepted way to do it. we will set the ss, es, and ds registers to zero. These registers are <add a description for these registers>. And we will set the sp or stack pointer register to 0x7C00 (also known as where the bootloader starts) and the stack will move down meaning the sp register will get smaller as you add things to the stack.
In this segment of code we will first save the drive number which was passed by the BIOS into the dl register. The next 4 lines of code will set up the serial port. This is strictly necessary but will be very helpful for any debugging you'll want to do later. Setting up the serial port in 16-bit assembly is fairly simple due to the fact that we still have BIOS interrupts to work with. The rest of the serial port setup is pretty self-evident from the code comments.
